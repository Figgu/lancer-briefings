The mission, as outlined, seems straightforward enough: mechs and marines from the Rio Grande will deploy near a staging area location in **Nov Elysia**’s industrial district designated **Forward Operating Base Saber**. Once assembled, they’ll resupply if necessary and then move out toward the central district where the diplomatic talks were taking place, heading for the last known location of the captain and ambassador. After the VIPs have been secured, they’ll be escorted back through a defensive perimeter established by a second wave of Union forces to a safe location away from the fighting and extracted by shuttle back to the **Rio Grande**. 

The **Lancers** have been selected as part of the initial landing, which means they’re headed down to **Cressidium** along with the rest of the first wave. Because communications with the surface seem to be cut off, one person in each mech squad is being assigned an **omnihook** (Lancer, p. 114) to maintain **omninet** comms with the **Rio Grande**. This specialized piece of equipment is finicky, and tuning it requires a high level of technical skill, but it will allow the **Lancers** to send and receive reports to and from the ship if necessary. The **Lancers** should take care of any last-minute preparations or adjustments they wish to make to their mech loadouts, and then it’s time for them to board their dropship.
