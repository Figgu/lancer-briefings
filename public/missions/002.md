# Mission // #002
## Daybreak

# Mission Parameters
- Intel places the nearest transmitter within a nearby financial/ commercial district. The area is densely packed with tall buildings, and there are reports that the Vestan Sovereignty has begun to deploy air assets in defense of its strongpoints throughout the city. The existence of the jamming network also indicates that the Sovereignty forces have significant electronic warfare assets at their disposal; anticipate systemic invasion and localized sensor jamming/ optical camouflage-equivalent capabilities.

# Goals
- Neutralize the enemyâ€™s comms jamming network, then locate and secure Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee.

# Stakes
- If the lancers fail to neutralize the enemy jamming network on schedule, the LSA advance into Nov Elysia's central district will face heavy resistance, incurring serious casualties which may hinder their ability to retake the city effectively. Should they then fail to locate and secure Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee, it will likely result in them being taken prisoner or even killed.

# Rewards
- Following this mission, the Lancers actions will be recognized. Mission success may also grant them access to additional prototype Exotic Gear that they can then utilize during future missions to come.

# Reserves
- Teddy Bear(Custom Paint Job)
- Adjutant-Class Comp/Con
- Pattern-C Advanced Charges
- XC-BR Battle Rifle
